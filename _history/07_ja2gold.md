2002 brought JA2 fans the Gold Pack, which is a bundle of both JA2 and UB. But the version of JA2 from the Gold Pack is not identical with "normal" JA2. The JA2 Gold version is the definitive version of JA2, the holy grail of the Jagged Alliance franchise. What makes the gold version special? – It incorporates all regular patches and has even more bugfixes compared to older versions. But (more importantly) it lso takes some features and modifications from UB and incorporates them into JA2.
Things can be a bit confusing here, because the Gold version can only be identified by it's version number. To make it absolutely clear:
+ Version of JA2 ≤1.06 are "normal" version
+ Version of JA2 ≥1.07 are gold versions.
+ **Normal JA2 can not be patched to the gold version!**
+ Version 1.12 is the last official release of JA2 Gold.
Jagged Alliance 2 Gold is the ideal basis for JA2 Stracciatella!
