Jagged Alliance 3, an official, direct sequel to JA2 was a game that just didn't happen for the longest of times. There were some serious attempts, including one made by Sirtech Canada itself, before they went out of business, and the one by GFI, which later became Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge. In 2023 it finally materialized and might be the first sequel to JA2 to satisfy the fans of the series and/or to be a general success.
