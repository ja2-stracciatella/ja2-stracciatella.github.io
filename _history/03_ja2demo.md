In late 1998, JA2 was already in development for some years. Its release was delayed to 1999 and the demo was quickly released both as a teaser and to calm down the impatiently waiting gamers.
Two different version of the demo were released: An English version and a German version. Besides the different language, the two versions also featured a different team of mercs.
The demo is a nice teaser and has some original content, not featured in the full version of the game. Although the explorable area in the demo is rather limited, it still offers a relatively high replay value, just like the full version of the game does.
The Demo is based on the Beta version of what would be the full release of JA2.
The JA2 Demo can be a bit hard to track down these days. You can download it <a href="https://storage.rcs-rds.ro/links/4729f8d6-f44b-42b7-aa3e-e0ddc6deead6?path=%2FJA_2%2FOther_Stuff%2FDemo" target="_blank">here</a>.
