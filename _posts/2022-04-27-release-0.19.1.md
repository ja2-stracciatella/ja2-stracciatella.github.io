title: Release 0.19.1
---

The Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella team is proud to present a new minor bugfix release following 0.19.0. Most notably a crash related to assigning merc roles is fixed.

**IMPORTANT**: If you had several save game folders from using different mods, you will have to manually (arbitrarily) rename the files and move them into the main `SavedGames` folder.

**NOTE**: Automatic brightness correction has been disabled, so pass eg. `-brightness 1.3` on the command line if you need to increase brightness/gamma to 130%.

We are shipping pre-built packages for Linux, Windows and macOS. This should help users to easily get started with Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella. For users willing to take a risk we also provide automatically created [nightly builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/ja2-builds/index.html#nightlies/).
