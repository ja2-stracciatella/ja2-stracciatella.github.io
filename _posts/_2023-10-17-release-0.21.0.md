title: Release 0.21.0
---

The Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella team is proud to present a new release showcasing about a year of work. It includes several new features, plenty of bugfixes
compared to previous versions and the original game, clean-ups of the old code base and a notable speedup. 

Through 327 commits at least 40 bugs were fixed, 22 of which are known to affect vanilla.

## New Features:
  - Improvements to the Android port
  - Middle-click mouse scrolling support
  - Modding Improvements
    - More hardcoded values and assumptions are now externalized to additional or improved json files for easy editing in JSON: translations
    - More extension points for LUA scripting: strategic-level content

**IMPORTANT**: If you used older versions of JA2 Stracciatella on Android before you might need to uninstall them before installing the new release. Make sure to backup your data before doing this as it might erase your saves.

We are shipping pre-built packages for Linux, Windows, macOS and Android. This should help users to easily get started with Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella. For users willing to take a risk we also provide automatically created [nightly builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/ja2-builds/index.html#nightlies/).
