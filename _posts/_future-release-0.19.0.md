title: Release 0.19.0
---

The Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella team is proud to present a new release showcasing a year of work. It includes several new features, plenty of bugfixes compared to previous versions and the original game, clean-ups of the old code base, and most notably a new saving&loading screen. Our Chinese fans will now be able to play the game in their own language (zh_CN).

(stats as of 2022-04-13) Through 275 commits at least 41 bugs were fixed, 15 of which are known to affect vanilla.

__New Features__:
  - (Simplified) Chinese language support
  - Support for arbitrary amounts of saved games which are all displayed in the same list whether with or without mods
  - Modding improvements
    - More hardcoded values and assumptions are now externalized to additional or improved json files for easy editing (item graphics, vehicles, starting sector, squad size, weapon shooting sounds)
    - Mods can provide manifest files with important metadata â€” to be displayed in the launcher and stored in saved games
  - Configurable website loading time, maximum squad size game speed and an option to refill totally defeated patrol groups (set in `game.json`)
  - The optional chance-to-hit now accounts for aiming and is not tied to F, but `show_hit_chance` in `game.json`
  - Improvements to the android work-in-progress port and support for the Apple M1 chips

**NOTE**: automatic brightness correction has been disabled, so pass eg. `-brightness 1.3` on the command line if you need to increase brightness/gamma to 130%.

We are shipping pre-built packages for Linux, Windows and OS X. This should help users to easily get started with Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella. For users willing to take a risk we also provide automatically created [nightly builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/ja2-builds/index.html#nightlies/).
