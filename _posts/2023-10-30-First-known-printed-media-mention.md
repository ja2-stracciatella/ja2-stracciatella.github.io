[Jazbina](https://jazbina.si/collections/revija-jazbina), a reborn Slovenian gaming magazine,
recently featured a retrospective of the Jagged Alliance [series](history.md) in its issue 15.
JA1 and JA2 had their own article full of praise, noting the community is what kept the game
alive. At the end JA2 Stracciatella got a quick mention:

Translation: "Garage upgrades like Deidranna Lives and JA2-Stracciatella provide fun to thousands of hardcore fans to this day."
