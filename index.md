The goal of the project is to make Jagged Alliance 2 available on a wide range of platforms, improve its stability, fix bugs and provide a stable platform for mod development.

Data files from the original game are still required and will be used by JA2-Stracciatella.

## Features

While much of the focus of the project is on fixing bugs through cleaning up and modernizing the code, several minor and major [new features](features.md) (the chocolate that makes vanilla stracciatella) have been added as well. Additionally, many optional tweaks are only a [configuration](how-to-run.md/#extra-configuration-and-modding) switch away.

#### Why Stracciatella?

The name is an allusion to calling an un-modded version the "vanilla" version. The goal of this project is to improve the game without changes that would feel out of place. The end result still looks like vanilla, with some improvements mixed in just like the pieces of chocolate in stracciatella.
